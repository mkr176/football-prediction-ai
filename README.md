## Setup 🔧

### 1. Create Virtual Environment
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd football-prediction-ai

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Quick Test (Recommended First)
```bash
# Test the tennis-inspired system with 15-year historical data
python3 src/historical_data_collector.py    # Collect 15 years of data (5,700+ matches)
python3 src/elo_system.py                   # Test ELO rating system
python3 src/enhanced_predict.py             # Test prediction interface
```

### 4. Full Training Pipeline
```bash
# Run complete pipeline (after testing)
python run_complete_pipeline.py

# OR run individual steps:
python src/data_collector.py                # Collect basic data
python src/enhanced_train_models.py         # Train tennis-inspired model  
python src/enhanced_predict.py              # Make predictions
```

### 5. Advanced Usage
```bash
# Tennis-inspired enhanced prediction with historical ELO
python src/enhanced_predict.py

# World Cup tournament prediction
python src/world_cup_predictor.py

# ELO system with 15-year evolution
python src/elo_system.py

# Detailed analysis (Jupyter notebook)
jupyter notebook notebooks/analysis_and_visualization.ipynb

# Comprehensive data collection (tennis-level detail)
python src/enhanced_data_collector.py
```

### 6. Testing Individual Components
```bash
# Test ELO ratings (should show team rankings)
python3 src/elo_system.py

# Test data collection (creates 172+ features)
python3 src/enhanced_data_collector.py

# Test prediction system (interactive interface)
python3 src/enhanced_predict.py

# Generate 15-year historical dataset (5,700+ matches)
python3 src/historical_data_collector.py
```

## Target: 85%+ Prediction Accuracy 🎾
Inspired by successful tennis prediction achieving 85% accuracy using:
- ELO rating system as primary feature
- XGBoost optimization
- Competition-specific performance tracking
- Comprehensive feature engineering

## Tennis Model Inspiration 🎾

This project is directly inspired by a YouTube tennis prediction model that achieved **85% accuracy**. Key insights applied:

### What Made Tennis Model Successful:
1. **ELO Rating System**: Most important feature - adapted from chess/tennis to football
2. **XGBoost Algorithm**: Outperformed Random Forest (85% vs 76%)
3. **Surface-Specific Performance**: Tennis courts → Football competitions
4. **Comprehensive Data**: "Every break point, every double fault" → Every shot, tackle, pass
5. **Aggressive Optimization**: 100+ hyperparameter tuning trials

### Football Adaptations:
- **Team ELO**: Overall, competition-specific, home/away ratings
- **Match Events**: 67+ detailed statistics per match
- **Competition Weights**: World Cup (60), Champions League (40), Premier League (32)
- **Form Analysis**: Recent performance trends and momentum
- **Confidence Scoring**: High-threshold predictions (75%+)
